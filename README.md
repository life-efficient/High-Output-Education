# High-Output-Teaching

This repo contains practical tips and tricks that I've learnt from teaching over 1000 people.

## Teaching live

### Asking questions
- Ask lots of questions
- Ask questions to check understanding 
- Ask questions to inform your pace. You want to go as fast as possible without losing anyone.
- Ask questions to give practice by forcing students to retrieve and apply information
- Ask questions after summarising each logical chunk of content.
- Ask questions to students by name. Replace questions like "Any questions?" or "What do I do here?" with questions directed to individuals by name. The cumulative time waiting for someone to nominate themselves really adds up and kills the pace of a lesson.
- Don't ask questions that students can't be expected to know the answer to. E.g. Don't ask "what is Docker?" when you're about to teach them what Docker is.
- Keep a list of all student names in the class and tally up how many questions you've asked each of them as you go. This helps you to engage the whole class.
- When someone gives a wrong answer, ask them why they think that.
- Always give appreciation for any contribution given by a student by saying "Thanks for that" or "Great work" (but keep it quick and sharp)
- Don’t be scared to correct students. You can always add to their answer if they miss something. It is dangerous to not correct them when they say something wrong, especially in front of the class.
- Ask students to clarify if they give a poor explanation. You can say something like “Yes, you’re on the right track, but do you think you can you explain that a little better?”
- If they get something wrong or seem to be veering further and further off course, then stop them sooner rather than later. Don't let them give a 5 minute monologue before you correct their first sentence. To use Andy Grove’s manufacturing analogy, you want to do an “in-process inspection” to fix things before they become a bigger problem down the line.
- If it's clear nobody knows the answer, give everyone a minute to try to find it out by looking it up or referring to previous content, rather than letting them guess blindly. They'll learn more this way.

### Other tips to engage the class
- It's your fault as a teacher if someone is falling asleep in your class.
- Change the mode of the lesson frequently e.g. listening -> implementing -> group work -> group work with teacher supervision -> class discussion ...
- Remember to take a break at least every 45 minutes

### Answering questions
- If you have to give a long answer, try to summarise it succinctly. Can you distil it into one sentence?

#### Useful structures for answering questions
1. Lead the student to the answer by asking them questions
    - Useful when we are trying to get a grasp of how something works and build intuition
    - Helps understand where their misunderstandings are
2. Go straight to the data, then justify it
      - Provide an answer, and then go on to justify it with examples or clarifications or new explanations
      - Useful for clearing up misconceptions, which should be killed immediately before providing an alternative explanation.

### Presenting information
- Take it slow to highlight important things. Your pacing is an indication of the importance of content.
- Try to avoid lots of information being presented at once. Presentation slides should change only by a small amount each time. Use color and structure to direct attention.
- If lots of information is presented at once, use your mouse of a pointer to direct attention to where it's needed.
- Conclude logical chunks of content with summarisations
  - Make sure your summaries have better conclusions than "so yeah..."
- Give applied examples
  - "You might come across this problem..."
  - Given someone's background, a particular application might make more sense than another
- Use simple language. Empathise with the current knowledge of the class.
- Don’t rush

### Practice
- Practice, lots!
- Students need to practice way more than people think. I mean literally every 10 minutes. Everything can be broken down into 10 minute chunks - and each of them will have some practical opportunity for the student to apply the knowledge gained.
- Practice can take many forms. E.G:
  - 1 minute to look something up
  - 2 minutes to implement what I just demo'd on your own
  - 10 minutes to work on a small challenge in a group of 3
  - 15 minutes to start group work on a bigger challenge before coming back together to share your progress

### Group work
- Working in groups makes classes social and fun
- A great chance for group work is to run through a drill of something not directly related to the class, that they’ve already done, that they have seen how to do already, and now need to practice.
- Break out for 10 minutes with a challenge, then come back together to share progress so far, but then break back out for another 10 minutes to continue with the SAME challenge and repeat until you have spent long enough on this (depends on what it is)

### Live demos
- When you run into a problem in front of the class, walk through your thought process as you solve it, rather than just solving it silently. Teach people how to solve problems for themselves.

## Lesson planning

This is the key thing you can do to improve the student lesson experience.
