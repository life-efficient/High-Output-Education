  - description: define groups to be in for junior engineers based on specialisation project they're on.
    - expected_positives: 
      - They could be missing out on key knowledge that other engineers from other cohorts have to progress with the project.
      - Engineers will have more support from other junior engineers instead of being alone in a room.
      - improves their teamwork skills and collaboration
    - expected_negatives:
        - Members of different cohorts won't want to mix. 

  - description: Create a poll to have users pick which demo they would like run on a given day.
    - expected_positives:
      - We will have the majority of users getting the demo we want.
      - We'll get better insight to which demos users most enjoy whether that's seeing interesting AI demos or demos related to content.
      - We can then rank the demos of most popular so we get a better idea of which ones to run?
    - expected_negatives:
      - Small proportion of the users that need help most won't be getting the demo they want.

  - description: Have an alumni engineer run a demo
    - expected_positives:
      - Get insight into how things might be done in industry
      - Gives junior engineers inspiration for where they could be once completing the course
    - expected_negatives:
      - Possible alumni engineers wouldn't want to show things they have learned in industry due to confidentiality 
      - Alumni engineers might opt not to do it

  - description: Alumni engineers assigned to specific junior engineers to help with projects
    - expected_positives:
      - junior engineers have a direct contact to help with the project they know where to go
      - Takes time off the teams hands to help with projects
    - expected_negatives:
      - May be too time consuming for alumni engineers
  
  - description: Assign team members direct contact for helping students with project
    - expected_positives:
      - Junior engineers know who their point of contact will be for the project
      - Saves time with other team members not knowing the progress of each student saving time.
