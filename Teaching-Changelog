2021-12-08
- Named dynamic cohort grouping software "dynaco"
- Updated dynaco to also generate an agenda and add it to the message to send to each group
- Add a new rule: every student has to see at least one of the teaching team during every session
- Implement immediate feedback for anyone who gives a demo at end of meeting - what a fantastic way to train them
- First alumni engineer (Eddy) asks questions based on those defined in the content
- Starting to feel like notebooks are a limiting format. Sometimes you need to do practicals mid-way through, rather than reading the whole noebook, and then doing all of the practicals.
- Ahmed had the idea that we could broadcast a message to the rooms 5 mins before wrapping up to prepare everyone. Literally never noticed that broadcast feature.
- Eddy had the idea to close the breakout rooms at the end like we used to... why did we stop doing that?

2021-12-30
- Ensured that everyone in each group was in the same starting cohort after someone said it seemed like they were being made to teach others
- Defined questions in the content

2021-11-29
- Introduce demos to bring back some form of live teaching
- Dynamic cohorts - groups are generated programmatically to group people working on nearby lessons together. This software also saves the exact message you should share with a group to a file, detailing who is in what room.
