# Teaching changelog

2022-04-20
- Named the breakout rooms. This allowed users to self-organise. This already seems to have had a great impact. Previously, manual input from instructors was required to explain to people where they should be.
- Removed telling users which group to go to in the daily agenda message. Users now self-organise instead.
- Removed the default items from the agenda message which was sent to users on a daily basis. This should be the default behaviour so we should stop telling users that this is the exact time they should be doing it.

2022-04-19
- Planned to start tracking user engagement by monitoring task-days (tasks checked off multiplied by their expected duration in days)

2022-03-16
- Started creating "microcontent" by breaking up the lesson on Evaluation Metrics into 10 micro lessons

2021-01-19
- Added content library to user facing Portal

2021-01-16
- Created OKR automated task prioritisation sheet to start using this week

2021-01-14
- Project based pathways

2021-01-13
- Defined an actual process for navigating around the rooms

2021-12-08
- Updated dynaco to also generate an agenda and add it to the message to send to each group
- Add a new rule: every student has to see at least one of the teaching team during every session
- Implement immediate feedback for anyone who gives a demo at end of meeting - what a fantastic way to train them
- First alumni engineer (Eddy) asks questions based on those defined in the content
- Starting to feel like notebooks are a limiting format. Sometimes you need to do practicals mid-way through, rather than reading the whole noebook, and then doing all of the practicals.
- Ahmed had the idea that we could broadcast a message to the rooms 5 mins before wrapping up to prepare everyone. Literally never noticed that broadcast feature.
- Eddy had the idea to close the breakout rooms at the end like we used to... why did we stop doing that?

2021-12-30
- Ensured that everyone in each group was in the same starting cohort after someone said it seemed like they were being made to teach others
- Defined questions in the content

2021-11-29
- Introduce demos to bring back some form of live teaching
- Dynamic cohorts - groups are generated programmatically to group people working on nearby lessons together. This software also saves the exact message you should share with a group to a file, detailing who is in what room.
