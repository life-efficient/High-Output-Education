# Teaching changelog

2022-04-21
- Organised several members of the community to run presentations on the projects which they had recently completed. 
Attendance was massive.
Questions were asked from users behind the presenters, feedback was given to the presenters from those further ahead, those further ahead saw alternative approaches that they learnt from.
This facilitated a community-driven, crowd sourced mode of support for all attendees, including those presenting.
The lack of variation in the different projects actually proved useful, as it meant that users behind them could see approaches to the exact problem they were facing that others had taken.

2022-04-20
- Named the breakout rooms. This allowed users to self-organise. This already seems to have had a great impact. Previously, manual input from instructors was required to explain to people where they should be.
- Removed telling users which group to go to in the daily agenda message. Users now self-organise instead.
- Removed the default items from the agenda message which was sent to users on a daily basis. This should be the default behaviour so we should stop telling users that this is the exact time they should be doing it.

2022-04-19
- Planned to start tracking user engagement by monitoring task-days (tasks checked off multiplied by their expected duration in days)

2022-03-16
- Started creating "microcontent" by breaking up the lesson on Evaluation Metrics into 10 micro lessons

2021-01-19
- Added content library to user facing Portal

2021-01-16
- Created OKR automated task prioritisation sheet to start using this week

2021-01-14
- Project based pathways

2021-01-13
- Defined an actual process for navigating around the rooms

2021-12-08
- Updated dynaco to also generate an agenda and add it to the message to send to each group
- Add a new rule: every student has to see at least one of the teaching team during every session
- Implement immediate feedback for anyone who gives a demo at end of meeting - what a fantastic way to train them
- First alumni engineer (Eddy) asks questions based on those defined in the content
- Starting to feel like notebooks are a limiting format. Sometimes you need to do practicals mid-way through, rather than reading the whole noebook, and then doing all of the practicals.
- Ahmed had the idea that we could broadcast a message to the rooms 5 mins before wrapping up to prepare everyone. Literally never noticed that broadcast feature.
- Eddy had the idea to close the breakout rooms at the end like we used to... why did we stop doing that?

2021-12-30
- Ensured that everyone in each group was in the same starting cohort after someone said it seemed like they were being made to teach others
- Defined questions in the content

2021-11-29
- Introduce demos to bring back some form of live teaching
- Dynamic cohorts - groups are generated programmatically to group people working on nearby lessons together. This software also saves the exact message you should share with a group to a file, detailing who is in what room.
